#### Run SQL Scripts (in order):

1. **SQL Editor** â†’ **New Query** â†’ Copy and run `scripts/001_create_tables.sql`
2. **New Query** â†’ Copy and run `scripts/002_seed_categories.sql`

4. **New Query** â†’ Copy and run `scripts/005_fix_storage_policies.sql` (creates bucket + fixes image upload)

### 2. That's It!

The storage bucket will be created automatically by script 005. No manual bucket creation needed!
